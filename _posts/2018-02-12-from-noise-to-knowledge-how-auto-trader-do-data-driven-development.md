As the UK’s largest digital automotive marketplace, Auto Trader has never been short of data. Having a large audience, dealership customer base, and vehicle database, has the potential to give us unique and valuable insight into the market and our own products. Yet turning this data into insight that impacts our customers is never easy, and we'd like to share what we've learned along the way.

Our talks will take you through the journey Auto Trader has made in turning an untapped treasure trove of audience and vehicle information into valuable insight.

From building an effective architecture to gather and process metrics, to machine learning from our large bank of vehicle data. We will introduce our tech stack and techniques that made this possible and tell you about the pitfalls that we came across during that journey.

This open night is primarily aimed at technology professionals and enthusiasts who wish to learn about how we do data driven development.

### The Talks

There will be four talks on the evening covering a range of data related topics.

Mike Eves, Systems Engineer, will tell of Auto Trader's (ongoing) journey of building a centralised logging platform using Elasticsearch.

Catherine Leigh, Senior Data Analyst, will share her product discovery experiences that used R and Shiny to create and quickly evolve insight tools.

Andrew Crosby, Data Scientist, will demonstrate how vehicle image data can be harnessed for object recognition by building a neural network, based on Google's MobileNet.

Andy May, Senior Developer, will present problems and solutions for working with slow data-processing services using a Kafka data pipeline.

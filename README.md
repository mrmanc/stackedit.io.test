# Engineering Blog

This is our external engineering blog, created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can find the blog itself at https://engineering.autotrader.co.uk/

This is not a fork of our internal blogâ€”it is an entirely separate repository. Posts from the internal blog are hand published from that the internal repository to this one. See the [internal README](https://github.atcloud.io/AutoTrader/autotrader.github.atcloud.io) for more information.
